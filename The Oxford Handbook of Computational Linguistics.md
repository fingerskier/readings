Phonology
---------
= the systematic study of the sounds of language
~ also the composition of sounds

	Allophone = all speech sounds that represent the same phoneme
	acquisition
	diachrony
	orthography
	universals
	sign language phonology
	phonology/syntax interface
	intonation & stress

	vowels are voiced
	voiceless consonants require a following vowel to sound
	~ the consonant _assimilates_ the voicing feature of the vowel
	dative = nouns/pronouns & agreeers indicating an indirect object or recipient
	nominative = exposes the subject of a verb

	autosegmental


Morphology = the form of language elements

Lexicography = the creation of dictionaries

Syntax = the arrangement of language elements

Semantics = the meaning of language elements

Discourse = shared communication

Pragmatics = the usage of language

Deixis = the function/use of deictic words

Deictic = words that change meaning based on context (you, me, they)

Presupposition = a thing tacitly assumed beforehand

Implicature = implying a meaning beyond the literal
