Desiring God
John Piper


We are far too easily pleased
	we settle for worldly pleasures when heavenly ones await

enjoyment begets praise

God is most glorified when He is known, not just seen

praise without pleasure is hyprocricy

joy is not a moral criteria
	but joy is a command (and joy in a certain manner)

Take joy in charity
	Mic 6:8
	Rom 12:8
	Heb 10:34
	2Cor 9:7
	2Cor 2:3
	1Pet 5:2
	Heb 13:12

Heidelberg Catechism
	human longing fulfilled by God (i.e. satisfaction)
	what is my only comfort?

what is the center of God's affections?
	His goal is glorifying Hisself
	He enjoys His own glory
	for God, self-praise is loving

an unhappy God would be dismal...and scary
	Ps 104:31
	!we must be one with Him for Him to delight in us!

Prov 16:33
Matt 10:29
