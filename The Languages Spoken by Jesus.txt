The Languages Spoken by Jesus

Jesus speaks/reads/writes all languages
	this is a necessary starting point for the discussion

it matters what his day to day language was
	did people use multiple languages in speaking/writing daily?
		they do now (e.g. Europe)
		cultures were mixed in Palestine of that day
	evidence as late as 200AD

parts of Daniel and Ezra are "in" Aramaic

BUT Hebrew was always the revered language of Jews
	e.g. Septuagint [Greek] was never transmitted as a holy, inspired documentation

semitic words [?and phrasing] appear in the Graphei

the real question is: did Jesus TEACH in Aramaic?

?the Latin example
	in modern writing we may not translate Latin phrases but other languages may be translated

Acts 4:13
	Peter and John described as unlearned men
	they spoke, and wrote, greek

Septuagiant composed c.300 B.C.

Acts 26:14
	ebraididialektw = in the Hebrew dialect
	Acts 9:4
	: the statement was not recorded in the original language

Mark 5:41
	"talitha cum"

Various greek translated quotations from the OT
	some match the Hebrew
	some match the Septuagint
	maybe an Aramaic original
	some LXX quotes do not exactly match approximate the Hebrew

Acts 15:16-18
	James argues from Amos LXX vs. Hebrew

John 20:16
	he relates the language of the phrase which indicates two languages were in use

John 21:15-17
	αγαπαω, φιλεω = love, like
	ποιμαινω, βοσκω = shepherded, shepherd
	οιδα, γινωσκω = one thing I know, knoweth

Ἐλληνισ ~ Hellenist
Σθροφοινικισσα ~ Syrophoenician

εκκλησια
	among Gospels - only found in Matthew
		Matt 16:18, 18:17

υποκριτησ, פנח, godless/play-actor/liar

Hellenists in Israel from 8th century B.C.

:)	an ostraca was discovered which is dated July 25, 277 B.C. (written in both Aramaic and Greek)

The Jews [almost] wholesale adopted Aramaic under the Persians; they would have also adopted Greek under the Romans.
	interestingly, Latin was not the most common language
