Saccade Control in Reading


The optomotor cycle:
	Fixation -> Reflex -> Attention/Decision

The eye chains letters, words, sentences, and paragraphs to accomodate writing format.
Saccades cause skipping, backtracking.
! If we believe in i-language and universal grammar then doesn't it make sense that we also believe the brain has an instinct to read?

Reflexive saccades vs. voluntary fixation


Testing can determine saccadic control...can it also reveal if "saccadic data" is reformatted into Language?

Dyslexia is partly a lack of saccade control.
