Ten Conditions for Answered Prayer:

We must pray in the name of the Lord Jesus. John 14:13,14; 16:24.
We must abide in Christ. John 15:7.
We must be in fellowship with God. That means there must be no unconfessed sin in our lives. Ps. 66:18; Prov. 28:13; lsa. 59:12; 1John 1:9.
We must ask in faith. God wants us to trust Him. He is grieved when we doubt Him. Mark 11:24; Heb. 11:6; James 1:6.
We must ask according to His will. I John 5:14.
We must keep His commandments; not a legalistic observation of the Ten Commandments, but a sincere desire to do the will of God from the heart. 1John 3:22; Eph. 6:6.
We must pray fervently. James 5: 16.
We must have a right relationship between husbands and wives. I Peter 3:7.
We must pray with importunity, steadfastness, and persistence. Luke 11:5-10.
We must have first forgiven others. Mark 11:25,26."
