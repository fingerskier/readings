Intro to Profinet


Trends
	IIoT
	Industrie 4.0
		business
		functional
		information
		communication
		integration
		asset
	Remote diagnostics
	IT/OT convergence
	Open standards

Profinet Role
	data access
	uptime
	openness

Profinet
= mechanism to exachange data
	controllers, devices, supervisors
	deterministic

Determinism
	configuration | TCP/IP (variable execution time)
	real-time | Layer-2
	high-speed I/O | bandwidth reservation, IRT channel
	motion control | scheduling ~ knows topology
	31.25 micro-sec | fast-forwarding, dynamic frame packaging, fragmentation

GSD
= General Station Description
	XML

Device Names
	location
	information
	DCP process:
		controller broadcasts name
		device responds with MAC address
		controller assigns an address

Process
	fieldbus integration
	CIR ~ Configuration In Run
	Time-sync / stamp
	Scalable Redundancy

Motion Control
	drives, fans
		I/O
	single-axis controller
		I/O
	multi-axes
		I/O w/ coordination, synchronization

	IRT
		drive synchronization
		axes coordination
		bandwidth reservation
			guarantees delivery and synchronization
			requires switch to support IRT
		scheduling
			< 1 microsecond jitter
			knows source, destination, and data-size

I-Device
	controller as an I/O device

Shared Device
	modules in a single rack can be assigned to different controllers

Simple Device Replacement
	physical hot-swap without new configuration

Wireless
	works on any wireless ethernet gear

Functional Safety

Security

Fast Startup
	pre-negotiation of devices

iPar Server

Application Profiles
	agreement within a device family on how to use the data (via data structures)
	above layer-7

Diagnostics
	Device/Module/Channel
	SNMP, MIBs, LLDP
	MIB-II
	LLDP -> topology

Disparation
	work cells within a larger network can be linked via VPN

Installation
	shielding, grounding and connectors can make a HUGE difference in throughput


Device Classification
	IO-Controller
		exchange data with IO-Devices
		Services
			Cyclic Data Exchange
				controller <> device
			Acyclic Data exchange
				configuration
				diagnostics
			Alarms
			Context Managements
				connection processing (?)
	IO-Device
		sensor/actuator connectors
	IO-Supervisor
		HMIs, PCs, or other monitoring/analysis devices

	IOW
		devices provide data
		supervisors consume data
		controllers exchange data

		internally these devices may do other stuff apart from satisfying the standard

	System
		minimum
			1 controller
			1 device

Slot
	all slots
	- except for slot zero -
	have
		status
		diagnostic
		alarm data
		...for each slot
	for each data provider [device], on each scan-cycle
		status and diagnostic info is transferred

	Zero
		slot zero is the I/O-device itself
		this slot handles the device data
			vendor name
			catalog number
			hardware version
			software version
			blahblahblah

	all slots on a device must refer to the same controller

Module
	a slot must house a module

	types
		real
		virtual

	...gives a slot a specific identity

Channel
	...is one physical input or output

RDO
	Record Data Object
		diagnostics
		logs
		identification
		channel data

	acyclical
	connection-oriented
	queued transmission

Event Data
	diagnostic
		associated with a channel or I/O-point
		RDO comms
		NRT channel
		an I/O-supervisor must specifically request diag-data
	alarm
		_one type of alarm is an alert that urgent diagnostic data exists_
		RT channel
		controller only

	data is specifically acknowledged by the controller
