Profinet Role
	data access
	uptime
	openness

Profinet
= mechanism to exachange data
	controllers, devices, supervisors
	deterministic

Determinism
	configuration | TCP/IP (variable execution time)
	real-time | Layer-2
	high-speed I/O | bandwidth reservation, IRT channel
	motion control | scheduling ~ knows topology
	31.25 micro-sec | fast-forwarding, dynamic frame packaging, fragmentation

GSD
= General Station Description
	XML

Device Names
	location
	information
	DCP process:
		controller broadcasts name
		device responds with MAC address
		controller assigns an address

Process
	fieldbus integration
	CIR ~ Configuration In Run
	Time-sync / stamp
	Scalable Redundancy

Motion Control
	drives, fans
		I/O
	single-axis controller
		I/O
	multi-axes
		I/O w/ coordination, synchronization

	IRT
		drive synchronization
		axes coordination
		bandwidth reservation
			guarantees delivery and synchronization
			requires switch to support IRT
		scheduling
			< 1 microsecond jitter
			knows source, destination, and data-size

I-Device
	controller as an I/O device

Shared Device
	modules in a single rack can be assigned to different controllers

Simple Device Replacement
	physical hot-swap without new configuration

Wireless
	works on any wireless ethernet gear

Functional Safety

Security

Fast Startup
	pre-negotiation of devices

iPar Server

Application Profiles
	agreement within a device family on how to use the data (via data structures)
	above layer-7

Diagnostics
	Device/Module/Channel
	SNMP, MIBs, LLDP
	MIB-II
	LLDP -> topology

Disparation
	work cells within a larger network can be linked via VPN

Installation
	shielding, grounding and connectors can make a HUGE difference in throughput
