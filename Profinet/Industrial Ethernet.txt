Industrial Ethernet


Ethernet dates to 1970's
	IEEE 802.3

IEEE 802.3u = 12Megabytes per second
Full Duplex
Anti-collision, PTP links

ISO/OSI Model
	International Standards Organization
	Open Standards Interconnection

"All People Seem To Need Data Processing"

7. Application Layer
6. Presentation
5. Session
4. Transport	|	TCP/UDP
3. Network		|	IP
2. Data-link	|	ethernet
1. Physical		|	ethernet

Internet Model
	4. HTTP/SNMP/Socket/PROFINET
	3. TCP/UDP
	2. IP
	1. Ethernet

MAC = Media Access Control / physical address

Ethernet Frame
	Preamble
	SFD
	Destination MAC
	Source MAC
	Length/Type
	Data
	Frame Check Sequence

Encapsulation ~ higher layers add headers to each frame (packet) which increases size and processing time

TCP
	Transmission Control Protocol
	internet-based
	connection-based
	error control
	half-duplex
	Layer-4

UDP
	User Datagram Protocol
	connectionless protocol
	speed-based
	no error correction


Components
	Hub
		repeater
		layer-1
		not recommended

	Switch
		port restricted (by MAC address)
		layer-2
		needed features:
			100MB
			auto-negotiation
			managed (PnP)
			trunking (link aggregation)
			port mirroring
			VLAN
				QoS (Quality of Service)
				able to prioritize frames based on a field

	Router
		can interconnect networks
		layer-3
	Gateway
		can interconnect application protocols
		layer-7

Types
	LAN
	WAN (requires routing)
	MAN (requires routing)

Topologies
	Tree
	Star
	Line
	Ring

	Tree/Star are more efficient for administration

	Line/Ring are more efficient for processing

hostnames
	DNS ~ Domain Name Service
