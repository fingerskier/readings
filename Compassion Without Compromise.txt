Chapter 7
	LGBT tearing apart denominations
	Response: reactive or proactive
	
	Gospel: confessed sins, gospel embraces, identity shaped around God's vision
	?1) the believer w/ same-sex desire
		1Cor 7
		Biblical answer: single or hetero-marriage
	?2) opposing LGBT groups/initiatives
		civic involvement ?cannot? be a church ministry
		education is a Church responsibility [to an extent]
	?3) sinners in ministry
		gay = self-defined by a sinful lifestyle
		clear policies - a lifestyle that reflects Christian commitment
		not leadership, not teaching/discipleship
		what about other service?
	?4) gay couples at a marriage retreat
		rejecting the "legal" definition of marriage
		how do you approach this _gospelly_
	?5) gay church members
		policing thought: can sinners join a church
		does unrepentant sin preclude all "member" activities?
	?6) can an affirmer be a believer?
		Mark 9:42
		1Tim 6:3-4
		Plankeye - can we have unrepented sin and not know it...yet?
			God isn't done with that person yet
		2Pet 2:1
		Jude 1:13
		2John 9-11
	?7) forcing the church...
		Me: Christendom will return, but it won't be Biblical; the new church will adopt eclectic, eccumenicalism wholesale
